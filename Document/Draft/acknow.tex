First of all, I would like to thank Prof. Daniel P. Palomar for all of his 
help and guidance throughout the thesis. I sincerely hope this work will be 
the start of a fruitful relationship. Also, I am grateful for the work done by 
Jordi Castro, the link between Hong Kong and Barcelona.\\

Moreover, I want to express my gratitude to \textit{Fundació Privada} Cellex 
and CFIS. Without their help I would certainly not be here. Special thanks to 
Toni Pascual, who is the man behind the curtain. Thank you for making 
everything possible. Additionally, I am really grateful of having crossed paths 
with Miguel Ángel Barja, a huge professional and excellent director. Thank you 
for your willingness to help students grow.\\

Finally, huge thanks to my family for their unconditional support throughout 
my education.
